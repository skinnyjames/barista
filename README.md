# Barista

Barista was designed to be an extensible framework for writing and running a dependency graph of tasks concurrently. It privileges extensibility over providing a DSL, and provides tooling and behaviors for orchestrating tasks.

## Installation

1. Add the dependency to your `shard.yml`:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     barista:
       gitlab: skinnyjames/barista
   ```

2. Run `shards install`
