# Barista | [![status-badge](https://ci.skinnyjames.net/api/badges/skinnyjames/barista/status.svg)](https://ci.skinnyjames.net/skinnyjames/barista)

Barista was designed to be an extensible framework for writing and running a dependency graph of tasks concurrently. It privileges extensibility over providing a DSL, and provides tooling and behaviors for orchestrating tasks.

## Installation

1. Add the dependency to your `shard.yml`:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     barista:
       gitlab: skinnyjames/barista
   ```

2. Run `shards install`

## Run tests

* `docker-compose up`
